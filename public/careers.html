            A strong culture can overcome almost any set of poor technical decisions. A weak culture can’t be saved by
            even the best technology. Culture is just a shared way of doing something with passion; and these are our core

                    No vision worth pursuing will get far with just the individual. We work hard as a team.
                    We collaborate.  We communicate and default to sharing with others. We laugh. We
                    brainstorm nearly everything, all the time. We constantly challenge our own assumptions.
                    We have fun; and because of this accomplish more.

Be committed and optimistic about that vision. Take ownership of that vision on your own and with clients and deliver results.

            <p>
                Currently, we strive to build small teams of 5 to 8 individuals, each dedicated to a particular goal.
                Those goals could be as a product team for a client project or an internally focused team. Each team
                is autonomous, lean and multi-disciplinary in that it consists of individuals in all the roles it needs
                to meet it's goals and objectives.
            </p>
            <p>
                These teams generally have a very similar set of roles as it relates to managing and building products
                for the web.  Below are some of the roles we're constantly looking for to help form new teams or contribute
                to existing teams to help us grow.
