            <p>
                Software is about design, not just technology.  And the act of designing is a process centered around conceiving
                and creating original, successful products or services.  But the "why" of design is the part most
                often left out &mdash; you're designing something because a real human has a need that isn't met.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our process for designing and building products for the web and mobile that delight users and help them
                meet their needs centers around combining Human Centered Design (HCD) or Design Thinking practices and
                Lean Startup.  Both of these approaches seek to effectively meet and serve customer's needs through a
                systematic, low-risk path to innovation in face of the uncertainty that is modern digital product development.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page serves as our guide to how we approach projects with our clients.  It's a living guide that
                we'll surly update over time as we're constantly learning and experimenting with ways to improve how we
                innovate products for the web and mobile. It also focuses on our philosophy and how we run our company
                which is what drives everyone at Tandem.ly.

            <h3>Product Development</h3>
            <p>
                Product development consists of two distinct activities: <b>discovery</b> and <b>delivery</b>.
                Our approach ensures that each of those activities is ongoing through out the life of the product.
                And, that each autonomous, cross-functional team engages in each activity to ensure there is a
                shared understanding of the product and empathy for the user.

                        Why has design thinking been embraced not only by forward-thinking innovators like IDEO but
                        large enterprises like IBM? For one, it brings everyone into the process, not just designers;
                        Design thinking also helps scale the design process through large organizations.
                        allowing organizations to confidently create better, human-centered user experiences and
                        disruptive products.

                        The Lean Startup approach allows organizations to be more capital efficient and

                        relies on “validated learning,” rapid experimentation, as well as a number of
                        practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress (not vanity metrics),
                        and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions (pivot) with
                        agility, altering plans inch by inch.

                        Determining what to measure can be hard, but there are good guidelines, such as the
                        <a href="https://www.pierrelechelle.com/aarrr-pirate-metrics">AARRR</a> framework, or
                        <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/google-s-heart-framework-for-measuring-ux">HEART</a>.
                        Using these frameworks as a basis, we can instrument our code to track those types of metrics
                        that are important for determining value for our clients and whether we've moved the needle
                        on customer behavior.
